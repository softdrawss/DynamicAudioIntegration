## 🛠️ Technologies used
- **Unity Engine (C#) -** The entire audio system was developed natively within Unity using C# scripts and the tools the engine provides, without relying on third-party middleware.
- **No Audio Middleware -** The system does not rely on third-party audio middleware. All the systems implemented use Unity's audio system.
- **Ray Casting -** The systems are based on ray casting systems using Unity's native systems, that can be checked out using 
- **Custom Audio System Manager –** A tailor-made audio system was developed to handle real-time interactions, environment-based audio triggers, and adaptive music transitions.

>❓ Why no middleware?
>
> This project wanted to replicate the creation of tools and systems that would be created by audio programmers to enhance game engines.
>
> The project aimed to enhance Unity's audio systems without having to rely on third-party software, to simplify the systems as possible and make them as accessible as possible for Unity developers.
